# Cat Meme Picker

## Description
"Cat Meme Picker" is an entertaining guided project from the Scrimba Front-End Developer Program. Users select their current mood from a set of options, and the site displays a cat meme that corresponds to the chosen mood, showcasing dynamic content generation based on user input.

## Technologies
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## Learnings
- Employed `for...of` loops to iterate over data collections efficiently.
- Utilized `import/export` statements to organize and modularize JavaScript code.
- Implemented form controls such as radio buttons and checkboxes to capture user input.
- Used `querySelector` and `getElementsByClassName` for DOM manipulation.
- Applied `classList.remove` to dynamically change CSS classes.
- Incorporated array methods like `.includes()` and `.filter()` to manage and display relevant content based on user choices.
